abstract = {An inhomogeneous linear refractive index profile, such as that occurring in biological tissues, is shown to significantly alter stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy images. Our finite-difference time-domain simulations show that near-field enhancement and microlensing can lead to an increase of an object\&\#x02019;s perceived molecular density by a factor of nine and changes in its perceived position by 0.4 \&\#x003BC;m up to 1.0 \&\#x003BC;m. Thus the assumption that SRS scales linearly and CARS quadratically with density does not always hold. Furthermore, the inhomogeneous linear index can cause false CARS and AM-SRS signals, even for a homogeneous nonlinear susceptibility.},
